1.  Introduction

   This draft provides a contol plane support for SRoU(Segment Routing
   over UDP).

   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on GitHub repository
   which contains the draft: https://github.com/zartbot/draft-quic-sr
   (https://github.com/zartbot/draft-quic-sr)

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Motivation

   SRoU support udp transport session over internet, but it lack of
   reachability detection and routing control, existing routing protocol
   like BGP-EVPN did not provide Dynamic NAT traversal capability.

Internet-DrafDistributed KV Store based Routing protocol for August 2020


   This document provide a distributed KV store based routing protocol
   for SRoU.

1.3.  Overview

   The routing protocol is based on source routing, each of the ingress
   node cloud get the overlay prefix and dest location mapping from
   distributed KV store, then the ingress node could fetch linkstate
   database from this KV store and execute A* algorithm to search the
   candidate path which meet the SLA requirement.

2.  Node abstraction and registration

   Each Node has the following attribute

   1.  Role: the system contains different node type, role attribute is
       a uint16 value which contains:

     +------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
     | Type | Name     | Section                                     |
     +======+==========+=============================================+
     |  0x0 | STUN     | This node is used as a STUN server to help  |
     |      |          | other nodes discovery their public          |
     |      |          | address.This node must deploy with a public |
     |      |          | internet address or behind static 1:1 NAT   |
     +------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
     |  0x1 | Fabric   | This node type is used as a interim node to |
     |      |          | relay the SRoU traffic, this node MUST      |
     |      |          | initial TWAMP link probe to other Fabric    |
     |      |          | node and report linkstate to KV Store.      |
     +------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
     |  0x2 | Linecard | This node type is used to connect existing  |
     |      |          | network, it could use TWAMP probe other     |
     |      |          | Fabric Node or Linecard node                |
     +------+----------+---------------------------------------------+

                             Table 1: Node Role

   1.  SiteID: uint32 number, defined the node which belongs to same
       site or Automomous System.

   2.  SystemName: unique string type to indicate a node.

   3.  Label: unique 24bit value, allocation algorithm is described in
       the following section.

   4.  Location: Optional filed.  It contains two float32 value(latitude
       and longitude) to indicate the Geo location.

Internet-DrafDistributed KV Store based Routing protocol for August 2020


2.1.  Node Label allocation

   Each node initial TLS session to Distributed KV Store, and fetch a
   distributed lock with key "/lock/systemlabel".  The node will fetch
   prefix "/systemlabel" to get all label mapping once it get the lock.
   Then it will assign the smallest unpresent int "X" in the list as
   it's system label, and register it to KV store by key="/systemlabel/
   X", then it could release the distributed lock.  All of the fabric
   node MUST listen the "/systemlabel" to update it's local node mapping
   table, Linecard node may fetch the "/systemlabel" key when it need to
   optimize the local route.

   This System Label could be used for cSID encoding or VPN based client
   linecard node convert to it's tunnel address.

2.2.  Node registration

   Each node will send Key="/node/role/systemName" and Value="
   SiteID,SystemLabel, Lat,Long" to the distributed KV store.

3.  SRoU Locator and Route

   Each node may have multiple underlay socket which may behind the
   dynamic NAT, it MUST fetch the STUN list from "/node/stun" and
   "/service/stun" to get the STUN server address list, then send the
   SRoU OAM-STUN packet to the random selected stun server to get the
   public address.

   Once the socket get the public address, it will encode the udp socket
   info as a SRoU Locator:

   "SystemName/Color/LocalIP:Port/PublicIP:Port/LocalInterface/TXBW/
   RXBW"

   If the local socket has public address and port information, it could
   be added in the service list.

   The node MUST update it local servicelist to distributed KV store by:
   Key= "/service/role/systemName" Value= "SRoULocator1,SRoULocator2"

4.  Node Keepalive

   Each KV pair registration MUST have a leasetime and keepalive timer,
   Once the Node out of service and disconnected, the KV store MUST
   withdraw the KV pair after lease timeout.

5.  Link State

   Each Fabric Node must watch the "/service/fabric" key prefix to
   update its local SRoU Service list database.  It MUST initial TWAMP
   session over the service udp socket to measure the link performance
   and reachablity.

   Linkstate measurement result COULD send to the KV store to construct
   the linkstate Database by the following Key Value type:

   Key="/stats/linkstate/SRC_SRoU_Locator->DST_SRoU_Locator" value=
   TWAMP measured jitter/delay/loss result and underlay interface load.

   The Node CPU,Memory usage also could be updated by: Key="/stats/node/
   SystemName" Value="CPULoad,MemoryUsage"

   An telemetry analytics node could watch key prefix ="/stats" for
   assurance and AIOps based routing optimization.

6.  Sercurity Key

   Each node may update it node key or per socket key , or per session
   pair key to the KV Store:

   Key="/key/SystemName" Value="Key1,Key2"

   Key="/key/socket/SRoU_Locator" Value="Key1,Key2"

   Key="/key/session/SRC_SRoU_Locator->DST_SRoU_Locator"
   Value="Key1,Key2"

   During Rekey, the node must update both OldKey and newKey to the KV
   Store and accept both Key in a while to wait the entire system sync
   to the new key.

7.  Overlay Routing

   RouteDistinguish could encode by SystemName + local VNID The overlay
   routing prefix is encoded as below:

   Type-2 EVPN Route Key="/route/2/exportRT/RD/MAC/IP"
   Value="VNID/SystemName/PolicyTag"

   Type-5 EVPN Route

   Key="/route/5/exportRT/RD/IPPrefix/IPMask" Value="VNID/SystemName/
   PolicyTag"

Internet-DrafDistributed KV Store based Routing protocol for August 2020


   Each of the linecard node could based on import RT list to watch key
   prefix ="/route/2/importRT" and "/route/5/importRT" to sync the
   routing table.

   Each linecard node could selective fetch the "/stats/linkstate" to
   get the toplogy information and execute flexibile algorithm(SPF,A*
   search) to calculate the candidate path, then enforce it to its
   forwarding table.

8.  Control Policy

8.1.  Route control

   Inspired by BGP FlowSpec,Network operator could update the control
   policy to the entire system by using:

   Key="/control/RT/2/SRC_MAC/SRC_IP/DST_MAC/DST_IP"
   Key="/control/RT/5/SRC_Prefix/SRC_Mask/DST_Prefix/DST_Mask"
   Value="Action" /"SR Locator list"

8.2.  Access Control

   Each node may use the SRoU flowID field as a token based access
   control.  This token could grant or revoke by a policy engine.

   Key="/token/permit/flowid" Key="/token/block/flowid"

   Each node could sync this table to execute the access control policy.

8.3.  User identity

   Each of the endpoint may have it's identity or group policy tags, it
   could be updated by

   key="/identity/userid/user_device_id" value="group policy tags"

   Group policy could be updated and store in ETCD by

   key="/policy/src_grp/dst_grp" value="actions"

9.  Distributed KV Store

   ETCD is used in our prototype, we deploy an etcd cluster in main
   datacenter and place many of the proxy node on public cloud to make
   sure the node could be available connect to the entire system.  In
   some on-prem deployment, each of the nodes could act as a ETCD proxy
   to help other node register to KV store.

10.  Security Considerations

   All of the control connection is TLS based and MUST validate the
   server and client certification.

11.  IANA Considerations
